# K-Means-TFIDF

### Implementation of the K-Means algorithm by Lloyd (1957) using NumPy.

The program performs an K-Means clustering of documents based on their tf-idf values.
The output is a thematical clustering of the documents.
'
For all parameters, default values are given. A dataset must be specified when calling the script (python3). If the data doesn't fit the format expected, the code must be adapted accordingly.
